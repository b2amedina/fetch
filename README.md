# Design
1. Created a project that adheres to the Android app architecture recommendation (data, domain, ui)
1. Used MVI
1. Added hilt for dependency injection
4. Used ktor for network calls
5. Created a Main screen that has a loading spinner and a list of candidates (note: there is a 3 second delay to display the spinner)
6. Added some mock infrastructure for things like a candidate icon
7. If you click on a card it just changes the card color
8. Added commits for each logical step
9. NOTE: I sorted by listId and then by id (instead of name)

## Notes
To not invest too much time into this exercise
1. Didn't do anything on network errors
2. Did not add test cases
